# 1Year-Progress 🚀

Welcome to my **365-day mission** to dominate web development! Every single day, I will **create, conquer, and upload** a new project, pushing boundaries and building skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and later **JavaScript**.

## Projects 🛠️  
Each project is a statement of my dedication and drive.  
Organized sequentially (`Project1`, `Project2`, etc.), these are not just projects—they’re **proof of progress**.

## My Relentless Goals 🎯
- **365 Projects** in one year—No excuses, no breaks.  
- Achieve **mastery in front-end development**.  
- Build a **portfolio that demands attention**.
